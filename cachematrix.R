## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}
##What this function does, is that creats a matrix that can cache the inverse

## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
##And with this we can compute the inverse of the matrix we create above
